    <h2>üî• Message from Hell Office üî•</h2>
    <p>
BEIJING INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY  
OFFICIAL NOTICE OF ACADEMIC OBLITERATION  

To: Liu Yang (Student ID: [REDACTED])  
From: The Supreme Council of Academic Exorcism  
Subject:  

üíÄ YOU ARE NOT JUST FIRED ‚Äî YOU‚ÄôRE ERASED. üíÄ  

FINAL VERDICT:  

After hours of soul-searching, statistical disbelief, and genuine secondhand embarrassment, the panel has reached a unanimous conclusion:  

üö´ YOU. ARE. DONE. üö´  

Not on probation. Not on thin ice. You‚Äôre in the academic incinerator, ashes and all.  

WHY YOU‚ÄôVE BEEN ACADEMICALLY VAPORIZED:  

# DISASTER IN GRADES  

30 failed credits ‚Äî a performance so catastrophically bad, we‚Äôre submitting it to Guinness.  

17/100 in Advanced Math ‚Äî this isn‚Äôt a grade, it‚Äôs a cry for help. Or a prank.  

# ATTENDANCE ANOMALY  

48 missed classes ‚Äî we checked the security footage; were you even enrolled?  

0% Physics attendance ‚Äî Schr√∂dinger's student: both enrolled and never observed.  

# DORMITORY WAR CRIMES  

Nightly 2AM screeching matches with League of Legends ‚Äî neighbors thought it was demonic possession.  

Posting a "Do Not Disturb: Gaming" sign during dorm checks ‚Äî the audacity is legendary.  

CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR TOTAL ACADEMIC COLLAPSE:  

‚ùå Student ID: Deleted from orbit  
‚ùå Dorm access: Evacuated like a toxic spill  
‚ùå Transcript: Radioactive waste  

‚ò¢Ô∏è YOU ARE FIRED ‚ò¢Ô∏è  

(Translation: disappear immediately, and take your RGB keyboard with you.)  

Signed in permanent disbelief,  
Prof. Wang Lihong  
Dean of Academic Disaster Management  
Beijing Institute of Technology  

P.S. Your gaming setup has been exorcised and redistributed to students who can spell "GPA."
